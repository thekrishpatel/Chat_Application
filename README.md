Welcome to the Java Socket-based Chat Application repository! This project allows two computers to establish a connection and engage in real-time text-based conversations. The application is built using Java and socket programming concepts, providing a hands-on learning experience in networking, multi-threading, and error handling.

## Features

- **Seamless Connection:** The application uses sockets to establish a connection between two computers, enabling instant communication.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for sending and receiving messages.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Messages are delivered in real-time, creating a smooth and responsive chat experience.
- **Two-Way Communication:** Enjoy full-fledged two-way conversations with the other user.
- **Simple Setup:** Run the Java program on two computers, connecting through IP addresses and port numbers.
- **Multi-Threaded:** Multi-threading ensures concurrent handling of message sending and receiving.
- **Error Handling:** The application gracefully handles disconnections and network issues.

## How It Works

1. **Server:** One computer acts as the server, listening for incoming connections on a specified port.
2. **Client:** The second computer acts as the client, initiating a connection to the server's IP address and port number.
3. **Connection Established:** Both client and server exchange messages through input and output streams.
4. **Real-Time Chatting:** Users can send messages and see them appear on the other end in real-time.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the `Server.java` file on one computer.
3. Compile and run the `Client.java` file on another computer.
4. Enter the server's IP address and port number in the client application to establish a connection.
5. Start chatting in real-time!
